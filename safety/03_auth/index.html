<h1>Authentication</h1>
<h2>Use a Password Manager</h2>
<p>Using a weak password is a good way to ensure that your account will
eventually be compromised, in part because <a href="../glossary/#dictionary-attack">dictionary
attacks</a> can be run offline against encrypted
password files to find passwords that match common patterns. Using a
clever password scheme, such as the name of the site plus a word only
you know, does not increase security by much: whatever scheme you have
thought of, attackers have seen before.  And since people are often
identified on multiple sites by the same email address, as soon as one
site where you've used that scheme is compromised, attackers can guess
the scheme and use it elsewhere.</p>
<p>Reusing passwords ensures that damage spreads, so using a different
password for each site helps limit harm if any are
compromised. However, strong passwords are hard to remember and to
type, so always use a <a href="../glossary/#password-manager">password manager</a> that
generates strong passwords and saves them all under a master
<a href="../glossary/#passphrase">passphrase</a>. Your passphrase should be several words
long and something you are unlikely to forget. It does create a single
point of attack, but is still safer than choosing passwords yourself,
since password managers aren't fooled by similar-seeming sites like
paypaI.com.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing passwords down and keeping them in your wallet is not
necessarily a bad practice---it depends on who is doing it. For
example, an elderly person who finds tech confusing might well choose
simple, easy-to-guess passwords for their accounts if they have to be
remembered. On the other hand, they have a lifetime of practice
keeping track of bits of paper, and will probably notice if their
purse or wallet is stolen.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Use Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication relies on something you <em>know</em> (like a password),
something you <em>have</em> (like a security key), or something you <em>are</em>
(like your fingerprints). <a href="../glossary/#2fa">Two-factor authentication</a> requires
two of these together to establish your identity, e.g., a password
(which can be stolen electronically) plus a random code generated by
an app on your phone (which means attackers need access to you).</p>
<p>2FA is as important to security as using a password manager, but where
possible, you should rely on an app for 2FA instead of using text
messages. What you should <em>never</em> do is share a confirmation code, since
a common attack is to trigger a password reset and then call the victim
pretending to be from the IT department and ask them to read the code
back to "verify" your account. As soon as you do this, the attacker can
change your password and get into your account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many security experts now recommend using a physical 2FA key such as a
YubiKey, which fits on a keychain and plugs into a standard USB port.
Sites like <a href="https://techsolidarity.org/">Tech Solidarity</a> have
easy-to-follow instructions explaining how to set them up for a range
of popular social networking sites.</p>
