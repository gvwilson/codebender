<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<h2>A Few Gray Hairs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jess is now 40</li>
<li>Frustrated that their work isn't recognized or rewarded<ul>
<li>Simulator has almost a thousand users worldwide, many in agriculture and local government</li>
<li>But their promotion still depends on research paper publications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="center">
<img alt="Jess (older)" src="../static/files/jess-older.svg" width="30%"/>
</div>
<h2>Stay the Course</h2>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: continue to suffer</li>
</ul>
<div class="center">
<img alt="This is Fine" src="../static/files/this-is-fine.jpg" width="60%"/>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Surprising how many RSEs choose this</li>
</ul>
<h2>Option 2: Raise More Funding</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand">https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand</a> outlines a variety of options</li>
<li>You've probably already thought about all of them</li>
</ul>
<h2>Option 3: Commercialization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initial business model is a mix of:<ul>
<li>Charging for intensive tutorials and follow-up consulting</li>
<li>Adding features</li>
<li>Using the software on others' behalf</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jess must either become an entrepreneur or find a business partner<ul>
<li>Knows enough to avoid tech transfer offices at universities and government labs</li>
<li>Non-research developers encountered through open source are a better source of advice and contacts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Do Good <em>and</em> Get Paid</h2>
<ul>
<li>Commercialization is not selling out (despite mutters from some senior colleagues)</li>
<li>Given the uncertainties of government funding, it is the best way to ensure the long-term survival of the simulator</li>
<li>And it frees up funding for projects that can't get industry support</li>
</ul>
<h2>Option 4: Change the Game</h2>
<ul>
<li>Help build a community that can push for organizational change<ul>
<li>Get involved in grant review</li>
<li>Spend the social capital they've earned to run for a position in their professional body</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes, it means more committees and less time doing research...<ul>
<li>...but the alternative is the next generation of researchers having fewer options and opportunities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
<h2>Option 4: Change the Game</h2>
<ul>
<li>And yes, it's like rolling a very large rock up a very steep hill</li>
<li>But the social structures of research have changed many times in the last century</li>
<li>They're going to keep changing</li>
<li>You can help them change for the better</li>
</ul>
<h2>Choose Your Goal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be sure this is where you want to focus your efforts.</li>
<li>It's going to take years</li>
<li>It could well fail</li>
<li>There are many other things you could do</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nihil Pro Nobis, Sine Nobis</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nothing about us, without us</li>
<li>I.e., always ask those who will be affected<ul>
<li>Often turns up potential allies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Be Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>Few people would argue (in public) against fair hiring practices <em>in principle</em></li>
<li>But the organization has to implement something <em>specific</em><ul>
<li>People very well might argue against those specifics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start with whatever is likely to have broadest support<ul>
<li>Success breeds success</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Power Mapping</h2>
<ul>
<li>Who has the power to make the change?</li>
<li>What do they care about?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Your neighbors don't make policy for your local public school:
school board trustees do,
so that's who you need to influence.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Help someone who wants the same change as you get elected</li>
<li>Help someone who doesn't oppose your change in exchange for support for your cause</li>
</ul>
<h2>Power Mapping</h2>
<ul>
<li>Figure out who is going to be negatively impacted by the change you want and?<ol>
<li>Change their mind</li>
<li>Reduce the impact</li>
<li>Make it up to them</li>
<li>Sideline them</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Change doesn't have to be a zero-sum game, but it isn't purely additive either</li>
</ul>
<h2>Build Alliances</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I'll help you if you'll help me" makes the world go around</li>
<li>Hard when people want the same thing for very different reasons</li>
<li>But this is <em>not</em> cynical<ul>
<li>People whose beliefs are aligned may still have different priorities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conversely, some people will never be your allies<ul>
<li>If everyone wanted it, you wouldn't have to push for the change</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People with a lot of social capital are particularly useful allies<ul>
<li>But always look at how they accumulated that capital</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test the Waters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Refine your idea and presentation in front of a small group<ul>
<li>At every stage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Refining your idea" sometimes means accepting that you wanted the wrong thing</li>
<li>Sometimes useful to have an official skeptic<ul>
<li>Giving them a way to critique in private may temper their public criticism</li>
<li>And you just might convert them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But remember: the devil doesn't need more advocates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keep It Visible</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's easy to blog and tweet<ul>
<li>But that same ease has reduced these channels' impact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Borrow legitimacy<ul>
<li>Is there a newsletter you can be included in?</li>
<li>Can you make a presentation as part of some other event?</li>
<li>Can you get someone well-known to mention what you're doing?</li>
<li>Can you post notices in the lunchroom? The elevator? The washrooms?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always share a single point of contact that someone checks frequently</li>
</ul>
<h2>Collect Data but Tell Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sooner or later someone is going to ask what financial impact this change is going to have<ul>
<li>Be ready for that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But data isn't as powerful as stories<ul>
<li>Don't explain what kind of people this will help</li>
<li>Explain how it helped (or would help) a specific person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"If you've never cried when telling that story, tell a better story."</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mark the Seasons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Burnout is an occupational hazard for everyone trying to make meaningful change<ul>
<li>In part because we get used to doing things on our own</li>
<li>And don't share the load even when we can</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Celebrate when you can, grieve when you need to."</li>
<li>Not all of your allies will become your friends</li>
<li>But those who do will be able to share your victories and commiserate with your defeats like no one else</li>
</ul>
<h2>Two Modest Requests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Please decline to take part in conferences that don't support fully-remote participation
    [<a href="../bibliography/#Skiles2021">Skiles2021</a>].</li>
<li>Please ask leadership candidates in your professional society:<ol>
<li>What steps will you take in your first year in office
    to ensure that less affluent researchers have an equal opportunity to publish their work?</li>
<li>What specific changes will you make to grant and promotion review procedures
    to ensure that computational work is properly rewarded?</li>
<li>What specific curriculum guideline changes will you recommend
    to ensure that the next generation of researchers are properly prepared
    to engage in computational work?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
