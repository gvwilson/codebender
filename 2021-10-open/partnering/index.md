An old proverb says, "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far,
go together."  In my experience, this is wrong: going alone is good for a fast
start, but after that, both speed and distance come from having partners.
Researchers and practitioners can each do great things on their own, but both
are better able to solve problems that really matter if they work together.
The ten simple rules listed below may help mitigate the
frustration you encounter as you try to do this.

## If you are a researcher in academia…

### 1. Remember that companies work in weeks, not seasons

Academic semesters are rooted in the seasons of an agricultural era, but
practitioners in industry have to work at a more accelerated pace. In the time
it takes you to write a grant, a company might develop and release two new
versions of their product in order to keep up with their competition. Discuss
timescales with your industrial research partners early on, and be realistic
about how slowly things will proceed.

### 2. Be open

Research is of no use to practitioners who cannot easily find it and read
it. While Jimmy Wales (the founder of Wikipedia) may not actually have said,
"Open information drives out closed," the principle holds: with so much
information freely available on the Internet, any paywall or login barrier put
between you and your hoped-for audience will send a large number of people
elsewhere.

More importantly, these barriers send a clear signal that you do not care if
practitioners read your work or not: as one colleague observed rather sourly,
it's the equivalent of inviting people to your house for dinner and then
expecting them to pay for the drinks.

### 3. Value action over insight

The goal for practitioners is not to understand the world, but to change it. "We
know X" is much less useful to them than "we can do Y". When presenting your
findings, you should therefore focus on how someone might act on it.

One way to do this is to add slides titled, "What Difference Does It Make?" at
strategic points in your presentations. If you can't think of what to write
next, you may want to rethink what you're focused on.

### 4. Don't hesitate to sacrifice detail for clarity

Understanding doesn't have to be complete in order to be actionable. For
example, atoms aren't actually little colored balls connected by springs, but
that's still a useful model in organic chemistry. You may need to hedge
conclusions with qualifiers in order to get your work past Reviewer #3, but
those "maybes" and "howevers" can often be omitted if they don't change what
practitioners should try next.

### 5. Apologize in advance for the state of academic publishing

Modern academic publishing isn't actually a conspiracy by a handful of large
companies to line their pockets with government money that could and should be
used to lift researchers out of penury, but it is functionally indistinguishable
from a system that was. The best way to prepare your industry partners for its
Kafkaesque production pipelines and interminable delays is to have them watch
Gilliam's *Brazil*.

## If you are a practitioner in industry…

### 6. Remember that universities work in seasons, not weeks

The timescale mis-match described in Rule #1 is due in part to the fact that
academic researchers are almost always multi-tasking, and that many of those
tasks are things they've never been trained to do. As students, they juggle
several courses at once (which effectively means that they answer to several
bosses who don't communicate with each other). Later, they are responsible for
teaching, writing grant proposals, and administrative duties.

Collectively, this mean that their "work week" is only a few hours long, and
that they will often appear to move at a snail's pace. Be as sympathetic as you
can: they are even less happy with the situation than you are.

### 7. Remember that academic success is measured in publications, not sales

University presidents routinely make about the economic value of research, but
the only things that truly matter for academic advancement are publication,
publication, and publication. Researchers are not given grants or tenure for
doing things that are "merely useful", even if doing so requires a deep
understanding of subtle complexities and months of hard work. For all the jokes
practitioners make about the ivory tower, academic life is hard, uncertain, and
poorly paid. People stay in it for the love of new knowledge; respecting their
priorities is essential to building a productive relationship. (That said,
practical problems often do unlock the door to genuinely new research topics by
pushing researchers out of their comfort zone.)

### 8. Do the background reading

H.L. Mencken once wrote that, "There is always a well-known solution to every
human problem—neat, plausible, and wrong." Your problem is almost certainly
one of those, and is almost certainly more complex than you first realize. While
Rule #4 tells researchers to sacrifice detail for clarity, this rule asks
practitioners to make an effort to grasp at least some of that detail so that
you don't waste time reinventing wheels and so that your research partner can
think, work, and talk at full speed.

### 9. Don't overstate what has been learned

This rule is also a complement to Rule #4. The "maybes" and "howevers" that
researchers are so fond of do sometimes matter; if your research partner has
found that regular doses of a new drug seems to slow tumor growth in lab rats,
do not embarrass them by claiming that they have discovered a cure for cancer.

## If you are either…

### 10. Apologize in advance for the state of your data

The final rule applies equally to both researchers and practitioners. Files'
names and locations, the meanings of column headers in tables, how those tables
relate to one another, how missing values are represented and handles:
everything that has made sense to you for years will suddenly seem a little
foolish when you have to explain it to someone else. Apologize in advance, and
then forgive yourself, because no matter how bad your data is, theirs may well
be worse.
