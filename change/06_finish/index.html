<h1>Finishing</h1>
<p class="subtitle">closing the deal and what happens afterward</p>
<h2>Making It Real</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's possible for everyone to agree that your idea is great and implement it right away<ul>
<li>It's also possible to win the lottery three times in a row</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support other causes in exchange for support for yours<ul>
<li>As long as goals don't conflict</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make your idea part of something larger that has broader support<ul>
<li>But avoid making extra work for people during a crunch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bring in noteworthy outsiders who support your plan<ul>
<li>Even (or especially) if the official purpose of their visit is something else</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If all else fails, settle for a trial run</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Don't</em> whisper in the director's ear.
It might work in the short run,
but people will resent it,
and will either sabotage your implementation,
be less likely to support you in future,
or start using the tactic themselves.</p>
