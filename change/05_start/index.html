<h1>Starting</h1>
<p class="subtitle">where and how to begin</p>
<h2>A Framework</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="../glossary/#innovation-diffusion">Diffusion of innovations</a> model [<a href="../bibliography/#Rogers2003">Rogers2003</a>]</li>
<li>Steps are:<ol>
<li>Knowledge: person becomes aware of a potential change</li>
<li>Persuasion: they form a positive or negative attitude</li>
<li>Decision: they choose to implement, ignore, or oppose</li>
<li>Implementation: they follow through</li>
<li>Confirmation: the change is normalized or abandoned</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Key points:<ul>
<li>People can and will drop out at any stage</li>
<li>Facts aren't enough to persuade: people want numbers, but believe stories</li>
<li>Most people neither support nor oppose most innovations</li>
<li>Most changes eventually languish even if they aren't officially abandoned</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are other frameworks for thinking about organizational change.
For example, the one presented in [<a href="../bibliography/#Heath2010">Heath2010</a>]
analyzes it in terms of the conflict between our rational side,
our emotional side,
and our circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>Analyze one recent attempt to change your organization in terms of the five steps described above.</p>
<ol>
<li>What did the advocates of the change do for each step?</li>
<li>Which steps succeeded? Which did not? Why?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>What to Do First</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use existing social ties<ul>
<li>Successful movements are built on pre-existing relationships [<a href="../bibliography/#Beckerman2022">Beckerman2022</a>]</li>
<li>If people you trust tell you to give up or change direction, <em>do it</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start with <em>something small</em><ul>
<li>Less intimidating</li>
<li>Gives you a chance to build skills and community</li>
<li>Less damaging to your reputation if you abandon or retract</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pick something that is <em>already widely supported</em><ul>
<li>Improves odds of success</li>
<li>Makes you appear mainstream rather than radical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pick something that is <em>immediately useful</em><ul>
<li>Remember, most innovations languish or are met with <a href="../glossary/#passive-resistance">passive resistance</a>
    [<a href="../bibliography/#Scott1987">Scott1987</a>]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoid premature commitment to metrics,
and more importantly,
to target values for those metrics.
It is more useful to agree on
who will be responsible for evaluating the success of the change,
which can also be a way to make someone an ally.</p>
</blockquote>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Individually, make a list of three organizational changes that would satisfy the criteria above.</li>
<li>In a group, compare your list with those of of your colleagues.<ul>
<li>What potential changes did several of you identify?</li>
<li>Why <em>didn't</em> they include all of yours?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h2>Who to Convince First</h2>
<ul>
<li>Taken from [<a href="../bibliography/#Manns2015">Manns2015</a>]</li>
<li>A <a href="../glossary/#connector">Connector</a> is someone who knows everyone<ul>
<li>Help you spread the word</li>
<li>Will expect you to listen to others in turn (exchange of social capital)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <a href="../glossary/#guru">Guru</a> is someone whose expertise in some domain is widely respected<ul>
<li>"If Toby likes it, it must be good"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An <a href="../glossary/#innovator">Innovator</a> is someone who is constantly trying new things<ul>
<li>Least persuasive of the three because they are known to abandon most of the things they try</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note: do <em>not</em> attempt to convince <a href="../glossary/#decision-owner">Decision Owners</a> first<ul>
<li>"We think" is more persuasive than "I think"</li>
<li>And "we" usually have better ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="exercise">
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<ol>
<li>Individually, make a short list of people you think are connectors, gurus, and/or innovators in your organization.
    (Include yourself if appropriate.)</li>
<li>In a group, compare your list with those of your colleagues.<ul>
<li>Which potential allies did several of you identify?</li>
<li>Why <em>didn't</em> they include all of yours?</li>
</ul>
