<h1>Succession</h1>
<p>This workshop is a short introduction to handing projects over to new leadership
(or winding them down).
All of the material is available under an <a href="./license/">open license</a>,
and contributions through our <a href="https://github.com/gvwilson/succession">repository</a> are welcome.
All participants are required to respect our <a href="./conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<h2>Learner Persona</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vaida, 33, has a PhD in oceanography
    and now works as a data analyst for the Ministry of the Environment.</li>
<li>Vaida co-founded a volunteer group that teaches environmental science to high school students,
    and has been its leader for the past five years.</li>
<li>Vaida is relocating to pursue a new career opportunity,
    but wants the volunteer group to continue its work.
    However,
    the only documentation of how the group operates is
    one slide deck and a couple of out-of-date blog posts.</li>
<li>Vaida is working hard to prepare for her new job,
    which means only has two or three hours a week for the next couple of months
    to put into planning and handover.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This workshop teaches Vaida the basics of succession planning,
while the exercises help her figure out what changes she wants
and how to achieve them.</p>
